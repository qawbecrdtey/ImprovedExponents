# Regions of the memory, and the cells that a step leaves alone

A region is given by its first address `a` and its number `n` of cells.  `Inside a n b` says that
the cell `b` lies in it, `Outside a n b` that it does not, and `Apart a n a' n'` that two regions do
not meet.  `InOrder top [(a, n), (a', n'), …]` says that the listed regions lie one behind the other
and end at or below `top`.  All of these abbreviate linear inequalities.

`SameOn K μ μ'` says that the memory `μ'` agrees with `μ` on every cell that satisfies `K`.  It is
the one notion of "these cells are unchanged": a routine promises `SameOn K μ μ'` for the cells
`K` that it leaves alone.  (It is `Set.EqOn μ' μ {b | K b}`, stated with a predicate: the conditions
`K b` that occur are linear inequalities between addresses and are used as such.)  The usual choices
of `K` have names.

* `SameOutside μ μ' a n`: all cells outside one region; `SameOutside2` and `SameOutside3`: all cells
  outside two or three regions.
* `Kept μ μ' fr`: all cells below the free pointer `fr`.
* `KeptBut μ μ' fr out len`: all cells below `fr` outside the region of an output.

## How a fact is carried from one memory to a later one

A predicate `X` about a memory has one lemma of the name `X.keep` and of the form

  `theorem X.keep (h : X μ …) (hs : SameOn K μ μ' := by light_keep) : X μ' …`

where `K` describes the cells that `X` reads; `Seg.keep` is the model.  The argument `hs` has a
default proof.  So `h.keep`, with no argument, stands for "`h` still holds in the memory that is
asked for here".  The default proof `light_keep` uses every hypothesis of the form `SameOn _ ν ν'`
in the context, that is, the promises of the steps that were taken since `h` was obtained, and the
inequalities in the context that say where the regions lie.  In the proofs a promise is named when
the step is taken, as `same₂` in `rintro _ μ₂ ⟨sY, same₂⟩`.

`wrote μ dst f j` is the memory `μ` after a loop has written `f 0`, …, `f (j - 1)` to the cells from
`dst`.

   intros
   try simp only [Function.update_apply, wrote] at *))

/-- The work of `light_keep`; the lemmas in brackets are used when `K x` is simplified. -/
macro "light_keep_core" "[" ts:Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpLemma,* "]" : tactic => `(tactic|
  (try refine SameOn.cell ?_
   intro x hx
   first
     | (light_keep_steps x; omega)
     | (simp [$ts,*] at hx; light_keep_steps x; omega)

          SameOn K ν ν' whose condition holds at x. Look for the promise without an equation: \
          its condition K x does not follow from the hypotheses.")))

/-- `light_keep` proves `SameOn K μ μ'` (also written `SameOutside`, `Kept`, …) or `μ' b = μ b`.

It takes a cell `x` with `K x`.  Each hypothesis `SameOn K' ν ν'` in the context whose condition
`K' x` follows by linear arithmetic from the hypotheses yields the equation `ν' x = ν x`; the writes
`Function.update ν b z` and `wrote ν dst f j` are replaced by their definitions.  Then `μ' x = μ x`
has to follow from these equations.  If it does not, the tactic tries once more after simplifying
`K x`, which computes the lengths of lists.  The order of the hypotheses plays no role, and further
hypotheses do no harm. -/
macro "light_keep" : tactic => `(tactic| light_keep_core [])

/-- `light_keep [h₁, h₂, …]` is `light_keep` with the terms `h₁`, `h₂`, … added to the context; the
simplification of `K x` may rewrite with them as well.  So they can be promises, inequalities, or
lemmas on the length of a list. -/
