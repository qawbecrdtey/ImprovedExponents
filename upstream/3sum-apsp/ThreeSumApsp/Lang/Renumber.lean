# Two programs in one: relocation of procedures

A program grows by appending procedures.  To put two programs, each with its own numbering of
procedures, into one, the second is placed behind the first (`Program.behind`), and the numbers of
the procedures that it calls are shifted by the length of the first (`Stmt.shift`).

A run of a statement in P is then a run of the shifted statement, with the same states and the
same number of steps (`Exec.shift`, an induction on the run in which only the case of a call has
anything to do: `Program.getElem?_behind_right`).  So everything proved with `Ends` carries over
(`Ends.shift`, `Ends.shift_append`).
